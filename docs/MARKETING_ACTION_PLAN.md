## 📋 NEXT PRIORITY: Pinterest Marketing

Pinterest is an **underutilized goldmine** for game websites. It's essentially a visual search engine with 450M+ monthly users, many searching for "free games," "puzzles," and "brain teasers."

### Why Pinterest?

- **Long content lifespan** - Pins stay visible for months (unlike social media posts)
- **High intent users** - People actively searching for games
- **Direct traffic source** - Pins link directly to your game pages
- **SEO boost** - Pinterest pins rank in Google Image search
- **Free** - No ad spend required

### Pinterest Action Items

#### 1. Create Pinterest Business Account
- [ ] Sign up at [business.pinterest.com](https://business.pinterest.com/)
- [ ] Claim your website (puzzlynest.com) for rich pins
- [ ] Create boards:
  - "Free Online Puzzles"
  - "Brain Training Games"
  - "Word Games & Puzzles"
  - "Solitaire & Card Games"
  - "Kids Learning Games"

#### 2. Create Pinterest-Ready Images (I can generate these!)

**Optimal Pinterest Image Specs:**
- Size: 1000 x 1500px (2:3 ratio)
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Include: Game preview, name, "Play Free" CTA

**Priority Pins to Create:**
| Game | Target Keywords |
|------|-----------------|
| Sudoku Classic | "free sudoku online", "sudoku puzzles" |
| Word Search | "free word search", "word puzzles" |
| Memory Match | "memory games online", "brain games" |
| Solitaire Klondike | "free solitaire", "solitaire online" |
| Jigsaw Puzzle | "free jigsaw puzzles", "online puzzles" |

#### 3. Pin Strategy
- Pin 5-10 images per day (use scheduling tools like Tailwind)
- Link each pin to the corresponding game page
- Use keyword-rich descriptions (100-300 characters)
- Add relevant hashtags (#freegames #puzzlegames #braintraining)
